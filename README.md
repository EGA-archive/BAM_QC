# BAM/CRAM QC

The EGA currently stores nearly 3 million BAM and CRAM files — and this number keeps growing thanks to the collective efforts of the scientific community. To improve the quality reports we generate for each of these files, we’ve developed a set of pipelines that automate the use of several bioinformatics tools for comprehensive quality assessment. In case you'd like to use them, please follow the [Start Guide](https://github.com/EGA-archive/BAM_QC/blob/main/docs/Start_Guide.md). If you have further doubts on how the script works, you can check the [Documentation](https://github.com/EGA-archive/BAM_QC/blob/main/docs/documentation.md) file. 

In case you want to check an example, we ran the pipeline for you on a 1000 genome project BAM file. If you want to check the outputs, or learn more about the original BAM file, please check the [test](test) folder.
