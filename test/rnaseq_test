Hemos ejecutado la BAM_pipeline_2.py en un archivo rnaseq (https://www.ega-archive.org/datasets/EGAD00001002256), en una VM con una CPU de 32 cores y 80gb de RAM. El tiempo total de ejecuciÃ³n ha sido de: 
real: Total wall-clock time (actual time elapsed).
â†’ 152m48.964s: the full duration of the process.

user: CPU time spent in user mode (your program's own code).
â†’ 200m44.345s: can be greater than real if multiple CPU cores were used.

sys: CPU time spent in system (kernel) mode (e.g., file I/O).
â†’ 4m45.965s: indicates time spent in system-level operations.

ðŸ‘‰ In short: your process took 152 minutes of real time, used over 200 minutes of CPU time (due to multithreaded), and spent little time in system calls.
